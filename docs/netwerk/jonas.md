## Jonas Mertens

Looking back at the last year, what could we be proud of?
What has been good lately? What could be seen as a positive point?
What progress has been achieved? Is there nothing that has improved? Or is there?
What can we learn from this?
What would you like to achieve?
What would be the best thing we could do now?
